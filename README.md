# bubble_game
It is a fun bubble game where I use these technologies given below-:
HTML - to give structure of code
CSS - to make interactive and fun game 
JavaScript - for all the functioning and to update score, timer, hits.
DOM - it has the most important role in project from selecting queries to changing HTML and CSS.
